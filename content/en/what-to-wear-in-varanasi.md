When visiting this sacred city, it's important to dress respectfully to honor local customs and traditions. This guide will help you decide what to wear in Varanasi, ensuring you are comfortable and culturally appropriate throughout your journey.

## General Dress Code for Varanasi

Varanasi is a traditional city, and modest clothing is recommended for all travelers. Here are some general guidelines:

- **Cover Your Shoulders and Knees:** This is the most important rule to follow, especially when visiting temples and sacred ghats. Avoid tank tops, shorts, and short skirts.
- **Loose-Fitting Clothing:** Loose-fitting clothes are not only respectful but also practical in Varanasi's often hot and humid climate.
- **Breathable Fabrics:** Choose natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and rayon to stay cool and comfortable.
