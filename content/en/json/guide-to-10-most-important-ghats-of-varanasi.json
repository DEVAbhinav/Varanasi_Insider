          "text": "While it is possible to take photos from a distance (e.g., from a boat), it is highly discouraged to take close-up photographs at the cremation ghats like Manikarnika and Harishchandra. These are sacred spaces for mourning, and it's crucial to show respect for the families and their privacy."
