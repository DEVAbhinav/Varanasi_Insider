# नमस्ते! I’m Abhinav Pandey—Here’s Our Story 🚖✨

I grew up watching my father **Sudhir Pandey** turn a single Ambassador car into a lifeline for pilgrims landing at Varanasi Junction. What began as a modest **Vinayak Travels Tour** counter in 1998 is now **Banarasi Kashitaxi**: a tech‑enabled fleet serving 30+ cities across Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with special focus on women‑only Pink Taxis and curated Buddhist Circuit tours.

## Why We Exist

> **“Every traveller deserves a safe, transparent, and truly local ride.”**  
> — Sudhir Pandey, Founder

* **Safety first:** GPS‑tracked cars, verified female chauffeurs for Pink Taxi, and 24 × 7 helpline.  
* **Local soul:** Drivers are born‑and‑raised Banarasis who can chant the right ghat timings by heart.  
* **Fair pricing:** No surge shock. Fares are published online, and seats are confirmed only after you approve the quote—no hidden extras.  
* **Tech + heart:** I handle route algorithms and the website while Dad blesses every outstation booking with a quick “Jai Maa Ganga.” Best of both worlds.
