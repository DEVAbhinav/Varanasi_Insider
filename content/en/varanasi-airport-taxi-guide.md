## How to Book (Prepaid Counter)

1. **Find the counter** → arrivals hall, left side.

4. **Collect the receipt** – keep it; fare is all‑inclusive (no night or luggage add‑ons).  
5. **Proceed to Bays 5‑8**, show the slip to the coordinator, board.

## Using Uber or Ola

1. Connect to airport Wi‑Fi or mobile data.  
2. Set pick‑up **Pillar 12** (official ride‑share bay, formalised late 2023).

## FAQ

### Is there a night surcharge for prepaid taxis?
No. The amount on your prepaid slip is all‑inclusive. App‑cab fares, however, may surge at night.

### Can I pay with UPI or card at the prepaid counter?
Usually yes, but connectivity sometimes fails; carry some cash as a fallback.

### Which is better at the airport, Uber or Ola?
Check both apps on arrival; supply and surge differ hour‑to‑hour.

### How far is the airport from the main ghats?
Approximately 25 km (22–25 km by route), taking 45–90 minutes depending on traffic.

### What to do if I leave belongings in a cab?
For prepaid, call the airport police with your slip number. For app‑cabs, use the in‑app “lost item” feature.
