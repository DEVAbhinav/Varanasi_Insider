While you won't find snow here, December in Varanasi definitely has a winter feel. The days are sunny but cooler, and the nights can get quite chilly. Be prepared for a significant drop in temperature, especially after sunset.

Hereâ€™s what you can generally expect:

*   **Daytime High:** Around 22Â°C (72Â°F)
*   **Nighttime Low:** Can dip down to 8Â°C (46Â°F)

One thing to be mindful of in December is the fog. The **fog in Varanasi in December** can be quite dense, especially in the early mornings.

## Festive Vibe: Christmas and New Year's on the Ghats

While Varanasi is deeply rooted in Hindu traditions, youâ€™ll find a subtle festive air around Christmas and New Year's. Some cafes and restaurants, especially in the tourist areas, might have decorations and special menus. The ghats themselves don't have overt celebrations, but there's a general sense of holiday cheer and increased activity as people travel during their winter breaks. It's a unique blend of spiritual tradition and seasonal joy.

## Top Things to Do in Varanasi During December

December offers a fantastic opportunity to experience Varanasi without the peak crowds of the festival season.

### Witness a Serene Sunrise Boat Ride

While the fog might be present, a sunrise boat ride in December offers a different kind of beauty. The misty Ganges, with the silhouettes of the ghats, is a sight to behold. Just be prepared for a potentially delayed start due to fog. Again, always verify the latest government tariffs or operator websites for boat ride pricing.

### Savour the Seasonal Delight of Malaiyyo
This is a winter delicacy you absolutely must try! **Malaiyyo** is a frothy, light-as-air dessert made from milk, often flavoured with saffron and cardamom, and topped with pistachios and almonds. You'll find vendors selling it in the mornings, and it's the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day.

### Explore the Ghats on Foot

## Hotel Demand & Booking Advice for December

While December isn't as crowded as November, it's still a popular time to visit Varanasi, especially around the Christmas and New Year holidays. I recommend booking your accommodation at least **2-3 months in advance** to secure your preferred choice and get better rates. Hotel demand tends to increase towards the end of the month.
