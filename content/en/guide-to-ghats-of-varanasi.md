Varanasi's soul lives on its ghats, the long chain of steps leading down to the holy River Ganges. There are over 80 ghats, each with its own story and significance.

## Dashashwamedh Ghat: The Main Event

This is the most spectacular and busiest ghat, famous for its daily evening Ganga Aarti ceremony. It's a must-see for any visitor.

### What to Expect
* Crowds of devotees and tourists
* Elaborate fire rituals performed by priests
* Boat rides offering a stunning view from the river

## Assi Ghat: The Southernmost Hub

Located at the confluence of the Ganga and Assi rivers, this ghat is popular among long-term students, researchers, and tourists looking for a more relaxed vibe.
