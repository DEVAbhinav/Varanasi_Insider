## 1. Legend & Spiritual Significance

*Dashashwamedh* literally means “the ghat of ten horse sacrifices.”  
According to the *Ramayana*, Lord Rama performed the **Ashwamedha Yajña** here after returning to Ayodhya. Purāṇic texts rank it among the five most sacred ghats on the Ganges. Definately top place to visit in varanasi

Today this iconic ghat hosts Varanasi’s **grandest evening ritual**—the Ganga Aarti is a 45‑minute fire offering where religious priests ring synchronize bells, with shankh, and large lamps to Sanskrit chants.
