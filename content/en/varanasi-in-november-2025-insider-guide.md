## Varanasi's Weather in November: A Snapshot

Forget the intense summer heat or the monsoon humidity. November offers what I call "sweater weather." The days are bright, sunny, and pleasantly warm, while the mornings and evenings have a delightful chill thatâ€™s perfect for a hot cup of masala chai by the ghats. There's virtually no rain, so you can leave your umbrella behind.

Hereâ€™s a quick look at the typical temperatures you can expect:

*   **Daytime High:** Around 28Â°C (82Â°F)
*   **Nighttime Low:** Around 15Â°C (59Â°F)

## Dev Deepawali 2025: The Festival of a Million Lights

The undisputed highlight of November is Dev Deepawali. It's a spectacle that leaves even us locals speechless. We believe this is when the Gods descend to Earth to bathe in the Ganges, and we celebrate by lighting millions of *diyas* (earthen lamps) on every ghat, step, and balcony. It truly feels like the stars have fallen upon the city.

**Mark Your Calendar:** In 2025, Dev Deepawali falls on **Wednesday, November 5th**.

**Best Ghats for Viewing:** While every ghat is illuminated, the view from a boat is unparalleled. If you're on foot, **Dashashwamedh Ghat** is the epicentre of the rituals, but it gets incredibly crowded. For a slightly more breathable experience, I recommend finding a spot at **Assi Ghat** or **Raj Ghat**.

## My Top Things to Do in Varanasi This November

### A Sunrise Boat Ride on the Ganges
This is the quintessential Varanasi experience for a reason. Drifting on the river as the sun rises, watching the city come to life, is a spiritual experience. Youâ€™ll see locals taking their holy dip, cremations at Manikarnika Ghat, and the beautiful facades of the palaces along the river. I always advise visitors to check the latest government-approved tariff card or official operator websites to avoid overpaying for your ride.

### Witness the Grandeur of the Evening Ganga Aarti
The energy of the evening Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat is electric. The synchronised chanting, massive brass lamps, and incense smoke create an unforgettable atmosphere. Arrive early to get a good spot!

### Get Lost in the Ancient Alleys (Galis)
The soul of Varanasi lies in its maze of narrow alleyways. Put your map away and just wander. You'll find hidden temples, tiny shops selling silks, and the best lassi you've ever had. While exploring is a must, always be aware of your surroundings; our [Varanasi Safety Guide](/en/varanasi-safety-guide) has some great tips for navigating the city.

## November Crowds & Hotel Costs: What to Expect

Iâ€™ll be honest with you: November is peak tourist season. Thanks to the amazing weather and Dev Deepawali, Varanasi is packed. The crowds, especially during the festival week, can be overwhelming.

This means you need to plan ahead.

*   **Hotels & Flights:** Book them at least 3-4 months in advance. Prices can easily double or even triple as November approaches.
*   **Boats & Taxis:** Pre-booking is essential, particularly for a good boat on Dev Deepawali night.

> **TripAdvisor Snippet:**
> "Visited for Dev Deepawali in November and it was magical. The city was crowded but the sight of a million lamps on the Ganga was worth it. Our guide told us to book our boat two months early and it was the best advice we got! A once-in-a-lifetime trip." - Review from Sarah J, London
