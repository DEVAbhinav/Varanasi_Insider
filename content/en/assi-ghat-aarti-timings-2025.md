# Assi Ghat Aarti Timings (Morning & Evening) ‚Äì My 2025 Insider Guide

As a local who runs sunrise boat rides for a living, I‚Äôm at Assi Ghat almost every day. The most common questions I get are about the **Assi Ghat aarti timings**, specifically the **Assi Ghat morning aarti time** and the **Assi Ghat aarti timings for the evening**. Below is my insider's cheat-sheet with the exact **Assi Ghat Ganga aarti timing** for 2025.

## Quick Timetable: Assi Ghat Aarti Time

| Season              | Morning ‚ÄúSubah-e-Banaras‚Äù | Evening Sandhya Aarti | Duration  |
| :------------------ | :------------------------ | :-------------------- | :-------- |
| Winter (Oct ‚Äì Mar)  | 5:30 AM ‚Äì 6:15 AM         | 6:00 PM ‚Äì 6:45 PM     | 40-45 min |
| Summer (Apr ‚Äì Jun)  | 4:45 AM ‚Äì 5:30 AM         | 7:00 PM ‚Äì 7:45 PM     | 40-45 min |

*Timings can shift by ¬±15 min if the river is swollen or if lightning alerts are issued. Always re-check the evening before.*

## Why Two Aartis?

### Morning ‚Äì ‚ÄúSubah-e-Banaras‚Äù

Begins in the blue hour before sunrise with Vedic chants, conch‚Äêshells and a short yoga-in-public session. Locals treat it as a community wellness ritual; pilgrims bring copper pots for the first Ganga water of the day.

### Evening ‚Äì Sandhya Aarti

Starts just after the sun disappears, lamps reflected in the water like a corridor of fire. It's smaller than Dashashwamedh Ghat‚Äôs spectacle, but you get closer seats and it has a youthful, musical vibe.

## How I Secure the ‚ÄúFront-Row‚Äù Experience

* Alarm at 4:30 AM. I grab a kulhad chai en-route; the vendor at Bhadaini Bridge never misses a day.
* Reach by 4:50 AM (summer) / 5:10 AM (winter). That lets me claim a seat on the second step‚Äîhigh enough for photos, low enough to feel the river spray.
* Offer a small diya (‚Çπ20). The organising committee uses donations to pay the classical-music troupe; they recognise regulars and often wave us through the cordon.
* Switch camera to ISO 1600, f/2.8, 1/125 s. Smoke + predawn light is tricky; burst-mode saves the shot.

**TripAdvisor Snippet:**

> "The Subah-e-Banaras at Assi Ghat was the highlight of our trip. More intimate than the main Aarti. We followed a local guide's tip to arrive early and it made all the difference!" - Review from Sarah J.

## How to Get to Assi Ghat

*   **By Tuk-Tuk/E-Rickshaw:** Ask for ‚ÄúAssi Ghat main chowk‚Äù; expect ‚Çπ80-‚Çπ120 from Godowlia at pre-dawn rates.
*   **By Foot:** From the main gate of BHU, it‚Äôs an easy, lamp-lit 15-minute walk.
*   **By River:** If you‚Äôre already on a dawn boat tour, have the boatman moor upriver and walk down to the ceremony.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q. Do the Assi Ghat Ganga Aarti timings change on festival days?**
Yes‚Äîon Dev Deepawali & Kartik Purnima the evening slot shifts later so the flame-arches align with the full-moon rise. Arrive 90 minutes early to get a spot.

Rarely. If it's raining heavily, the priests move the ceremony to a covered dais. The public yoga session may be skipped, but the aarti continues.

**Q. Can tourists participate in the aarti?**
While you can't perform the main ritual, you can receive a blessing from the priests afterward. Simply queue politely to the left of the stage once the ceremony concludes.
