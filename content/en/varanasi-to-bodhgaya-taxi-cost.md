## Important Tips for Your Varanasi to Bodh Gaya Trip

1.  **Choose One-Way vs. Round-Trip:** A one-way fare is perfect if you plan to stay in Bodh Gaya. A round-trip package, where you are charged per kilometer, might be suitable for a same-day return.
2.  **Check Inclusions:** When booking, verify if the fare includes tolls, state entry taxes (for entering Bihar), and the driver's allowance. Booking with a trusted operator like **[Banarasi.KashiTaxi.in/buddhist-circuit](https://banarasi.kashitaxi.in/buddhist-circuit)** ensures transparent pricing.
3.  **Plan Your Stops:** The route passes through several towns like Jaunpur and Sasaram. You can plan for breaks at roadside dhabas for meals.
4.  **Book Ahead During Peak Season:** Bodh Gaya attracts a large number of pilgrims, especially during festivals like Buddha Purnima. It's essential to book your cab in advance during these times to avoid high prices and ensure availability.
