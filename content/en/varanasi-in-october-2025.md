With the weather on your side, it's time to be outdoors. Hereâ€™s what I recommend.

### An Evening Ganga Aarti

The evening Aarti at Dasaswamedh Ghat is a powerful spiritual performance. In October, the weather is perfect for sitting on the steps or watching from a boat without the discomfort of heat or rain. The energy is magnetic.

### Explore the Ghats and Alleyways
This is the time to get lost in Varanasiâ€™s ancient maze. The ground is no longer slippery from rain, making it perfect for a long, leisurely walk from Assi Ghat to Manikarnika Ghat, discovering hidden temples and life along the river.

### Attend a Ram Leela Performance
Specifically, the one held in Ramnagar is a UNESCO-recognized heritage event. Itâ€™s a traditional performance that has been happening for centuries and offers a deep dive into the local culture.
