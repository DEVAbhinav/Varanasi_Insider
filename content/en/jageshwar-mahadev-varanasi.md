## Why visit?

* **Living myth in stone** – locals swear the Shiv-lingam physically elongates each Mahā Shivratri, a phenomenon recorded in *Kashi-Khaṇḍa* lore and measured by priests.  
* **Siddh-peeth status** – considered a wish-fulfilling shrine; three months of consecutive darshan is believed to remove obstacles.  
* **Off-beat Kashi** – far quieter than Dashāśwamedh or Kashi Vishwanath yet only ~2 km north-west of Chowk, perfect for heritage walks.

## History & mythology in a nutshell  

*Skanda-Purāṇa* recounts sage **Jāgeṣvya** fasting until Shiva’s darshan. Pleased, the Lord manifested here, promising to reside eternally in a subterranean cave beneath the present lingam—hence the annual growth and the local belief that the cavern has “no end”. Attempts to excavate were abandoned after snakes and scorpions emerged, reinforcing its mystique.

## What you’ll see

1. **Massive, oval lingam** encased in a silver *nāga* railing. On festival days it disappears beneath marigold garlands.  
2. **Steep stone staircase** behind a pink-sandstone arch leading down to the subterranean *garbhagriha*.  
3. **Ancillary shrines** to Nandi, Ganesha, and Devi within a tight courtyard—ideal for a quick *pradakṣiṇā*.  
4. **Continuous bell chorus** during Shrāvaṇ Mondays—carry ear-plugs if you’re sensitive.

## Rituals & festivals

| Festival | What happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Mahā Shivratri** | All-night *abhishek*; priests measure the lingam’s new height grain-by-grain. |
| **Shrāvaṇ Mondays** | Queues from 4 am; devotees bring Ganga water for *jal-abhishek*. |
| **Panch-Kroshi Yatra** | Pilgrims often add Jageshwar as an optional 6ᵗʰ stop on the 25 km circuit. |

## Traveller tips

* Combine with **Mṛtyuñjaya Mahadev** (800 m) and **Tilbhandeshwar Mahadev** (1.2 km) for a half-day “Hidden Shiva” walk.
